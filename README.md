## <p align="center">What I'm About</p>

<p align="center">
  I build things that matter. My focus is on creating applications that solve real problems — whether it's safety systems for wheelchairs or platforms that connect people. When I'm not coding, you'll find me shooting on 35mm film or out for a run.
